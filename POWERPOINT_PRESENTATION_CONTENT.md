💸 Organizations waste 40-60% on cloud storage costs

❌ Current Pain Points:
• Data sits in expensive HOT tiers when it should be COLD
• Manual classification takes weeks, costs hours
• No predictive insights - always reactive
• Multi-cloud complexity increases errors
• DevOps teams overwhelmed with optimization

📈 The Scale:
• 1PB dataset = $660K wasted annually
• 10PB dataset = $6.6M wasted annually
• Fortune 500 average: 50-100PB of data

🎯 What if we could predict and automate this?
