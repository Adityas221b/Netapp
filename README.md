## 🎯 Demo Script (Practice This)

### Demo 1: Intelligent Classification (2 min)
```
"Let me show you CloudFlux AI in action. I'm uploading 100 files 
with different access patterns. Watch as our ML model classifies 
them in real-time...

[Dashboard updates]

See? 32% HOT, 45% WARM, 23% COLD. The system automatically 
calculated that we can save $1,320 per month - that's 57% cost 
reduction - just by optimal placement."
```

### Demo 2: Predictive Insights (2 min)
```
"Now let's look at predictions. I'm streaming live IoT data through 
Kafka - 50 events per second. The dashboard updates in real-time.

[Click 'Predict']

Our ML model analyzed usage patterns and predicts that in 7 days, 
these 45GB can move from HOT to WARM storage. That's proactive 
optimization before costs spike."
```

### Demo 3: Multi-Cloud Migration (1 min)
```
"Finally, multi-cloud migration. I'm selecting 20GB of COLD data 
currently on AWS. One click to migrate to GCP Coldline...

[Show progress]

Cost drops from $0.46 to $0.08 per month - 83% cheaper. Encrypted 
in transit, zero downtime."
```
